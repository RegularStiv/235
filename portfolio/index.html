            I am a Game Developer and Front End Developer from Boston, Massachusetts.  
            I enjoy taking new ideas and turning them into games and stories as well.
            Sometimes I find it fun to make fake websites for games or stories I really enjoy.
            Outside of coding I enjoy reading comics, playing video games with friends and cooking.

            <p id = "one-text">
                These are a series of exercises done in Unity. 
                They range in difficulty and uses both 2D and 3D versions of Unity.
                The goal was to get a basic understanding of Unity at first then get a more advanced knowlege of the topic.
                They were made for one of the classes I took pertaining to Unity 
                and helped me understand how to use Untiy, and C# Scripts effectivly.

            <p id = "two-text">
                This game is based off of the classic Snake game but is changed for the things I didn't enjoy when I played Snake.
                The snake goes faster as you level up and the layout and design of the game is aimed to look like it is an old arcade machine.
                The game is made entirely out of JavaScript, HTML, CSS and one library howler.js and without using the canvas tag.
                This was the final project for my web development class and the goal was to learn the technologies used in JavaScript by making a game.

            <p id = "three-text">
                This was a project for one of my classes where in we had to make a version of asteroids.  
                It is a version of asteroids using a from scratch movement using floaty physics so you drift a lot.  
                The goal was to learn how different physics are implemented and used in differnet games.
                This was made in Unity and utilized C# scripts to function.

            <p id = "four-text">
                This was my first game made with other people and the first game I made in MonoGame. 
                The goal was to learn how to use MonoGame and how to effectivly work in a group of people while working on a game.
                I worked on the AI, movement and level generation. 
                This was made over the course of a semester about three months but we really only learned the required information halfway through the course.
                 We were still figuring out how to make a game using MonoGame and then we had to move entirely online because of the pandemic.</p>
