    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>Use an API correctly and in an interesting way </p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I wanted to make an easy to use gif finder that would display the gifs that you search for neatly and anyone can use. <br>
        Using the giphy finder that we used in class I got my own API key and began first working on the functionality of the site <br>
        I worked on the onload treding page first to get used to the api and make sure I was doing things right. <br>
        Next I worked on the next and previous buttons to add important functionality and used the offset to acoplish this.<br>
        Finally I worked on the copy to clipboard function. I think this was the hardest for me to do only because of small errors that were causing everything to break.
