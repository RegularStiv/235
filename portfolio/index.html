                These are a series of exercises done in Unity. 
                They range in difficulty and uses both 2D and 3D versions of Unity 
                and include player input and AI obstacle avoidance.
                The goal was to get a basic understanding of Unity at first then get a 
                more advanced knowlege of the topic.
                They were made for one of the classes I took pertaining to Unity 
                and helped me understand how to use Untiy, and C# Scripts effectivly.

            <p id = "two-text">
                This game is based off of the classic Snake game but is changed 
                for the things I didn't enjoy when I played Snake.
                The snake goes faster as you level up and the layout and 
                design of the game is aimed to look like it is an old arcade machine.
                The game is made entirely out of JavaScript, HTML, CSS and one 
                library howler.js and without using the canvas tag.
                This was the final project for my web development class and the 
                goal was to learn the technologies used in JavaScript by making a game.

                This was the game I worked on for my first Co-Op.
                The Game is a vr narritive mystery where you play as Aurelia Walker, 
                a detective with the ability to enter the mind of whomever she touches.
                I had many role while I worked on this game, I worked on designing a 
                new level, development of that same level, 
                worked as a tech artist by creating and applying materials and textures, 
                and was the sub lead for the deveolpers of the level I helped design.
                This game is still in progress of being created and has come a long way 
                in the three months I worked on it.

                This was my first game made with other people and the first game I 
                made in MonoGame. 
                The goal was to learn how to use MonoGame and how to effectivly 
                work in a group of people while working on a game.
                I worked on the AI, movement and level generation. 
                This was made over the course of a semester about three months 
                but we really only learned the required information halfway 
                through the course.
                We were still figuring out how to make a game using MonoGame and 
                then we had to move entirely online because of the pandemic.
