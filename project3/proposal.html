    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>Snake is a game where you move in 4 directions followed by a tail. 
        You move around the enclosed space to get food which grows your tail and gives you points. 
        After a certain amount of points you level up and reset the game increaseing the amount of food needed to level up. 
        If your head hits either your tail or the edges of the screen you lose and the level you reach is displayed.</p>
    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>Desktop only</p>

    <h2>Story</h2>
